# Mana Cores Mod
Adds Mana Cores mod for Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead. The mod should be used in the experimental version of the game.
## What are Mana Cores?
Well, Mana Cores come in 8 flavors. Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, Purple, and White. Each is more powerful than the last and follows exponential growth at the later stages. Be warned though, for each mana core there is a cracked variant. A mana core cracks when too many impurities are in the core. I intend for the impurities to be hidden and your only sense of if it is a good time to breakthrough is when you get a good feeling about breaking through. 
## What do you mean good feeling?
I mean your mana core literally will tell you if you are ready for a breakthrough.
## Well, what else can Mana Cores do?
Outside of increasing your max mana and mana regen? Mana Cores also assist you with learning magic either through reading or actually practicing magic. There is also a single spell which allows you to gain a variable amount of mana based on your Mana Core tier. Be warned, overuse will lead to unwanted consequences.
## I think this is unbalanced and stupid and I have a much better idea!
Please, by all means make a better mod. I made this because I feel that there is a system missing for being able to improve yourself. Yes yes I know manatouched mutations are a thing but I never liked mutations. If you don't want to make a mod you can feel free to tell me either on discord or on github and I will probably try to implement it. I love CDDA and any change you want done with a good enough reason will probably send me on a quest to fulfill such a change.
## It doesn't require Magiclysm?
Believe it or not mana and spells are in the base game. Originally it was called Magiclysm Mana Cores but I decided to rename the mod to Mana Cores in case any other mods use mana but are not compatible with Magiclysm.
